# Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analysing retail sales data to understand overall business performance, identify top and underperforming products and regions, and highlight opportunities for improvement. The aim is to turn raw transactional data into clear, decision-ready insights.

The project follows an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from data cleaning and analysis to visualisation and insight generation.

---

## Business Problem
The business needs a clear view of:
- Which products and regions are performing well
- Which areas are underperforming
- What factors are driving sales and profit

Without this visibility, it becomes difficult to make informed decisions around pricing, inventory, and regional strategy.

---

## Objectives
- Clean and prepare raw sales data
- Calculate key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Analyse relationships between sales, profit, discounts, and other variables
- Identify best and worst performing products and regions
- Present insights in a clear and interactive dashboard

---

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is a retail sales dataset containing information on:
- Orders and sales
- Profit and discounts
- Products and categories
- Regions and dates

(The dataset was sourced from a publicly available dataset and used for learning and portfolio purposes.)

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **VS Code** for analysis and documentation
- **Power BI** for dashboard creation
- **SQL / SSMS** for data modelling (Star Schema)
- **GitHub** for version control and project sharing

---

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- KPI creation (Sales, Profit, Profit Margin, Order Volume)
- Correlation analysis
- Regression analysis to understand key drivers
- Identification of underperforming segments

---

## Dashboard Output
The final dashboard highlights:
- Total sales and profit performance
- Best and worst performing products
- Regional performance comparison
- Insights that can support business improvement strategies

---

## Key Insights
- A small number of products and regions contribute a large share of total profit
- Discounts have a noticeable impact on profitability
- Underperforming regions show patterns that can be addressed through targeted strategies
